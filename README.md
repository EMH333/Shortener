# Link Shortener
This is a simple proof of concept for a temporary link shortener. More to be added here later

### To Use
Just clone everything into a folder and run "main.go". The program starts a server on port 8080 which can be used as required. All links are stored in "links.db" which is created if it doesn't already exist. 


Any pull requests and issues are welcome! This is a super simple skill builder side project so I may not fix everthing but I have found it suprisingly useful to have this as a service
